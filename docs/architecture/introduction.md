# Architecture

Before jumping to the [global architecture view](./global-architecture.md) we recommend to read about the [main concepts](./main-concepts.md) of **KDK**. 

You can then have a look to the:
1. [component-oriented view](./component-view.md)
2. [data model-oriented view](./data-model-view.md)
