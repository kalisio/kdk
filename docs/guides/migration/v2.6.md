# v2.6 - Not yet released

More details can be found in the related [milestone](https://github.com/kalisio/kdk/milestone/14) on GitHub.

## Major breaking changes

💥 Renamed functions in `utils.locale.js` to resolve confusion between `getLocale` and `getAppLocale`, which previously led to inconsistent behavior and locale-related issues.
* Renamed `getLocale` to `getBrowserLocale`
* Renamed `getAppLocale` to `getLocale`.
* Renamed `getAppFallbackLocale` to `getFallbackLocale`

::: tip
Both `getLocale`and `getFallbackLocale` have a new signature and allows you to retrieve the full locale in the language-region format (e.g., en-GB). For instance, if the locale is `en-GB`, then
```
console.log(getLocale()) 
// => en
console.log(getLocale(false)) 
// => en-GB
```
:::

💥 Renamed `KLayersSelector` component to `KLayersList` and added new `KLayersSelector` component

::: caution
The new `KLayersSelector` component is NOT the old `KLayersSelector` component. They are entirely different components, and `KLayersList` should be now used in place of the old `KLayersSelector` ❗
