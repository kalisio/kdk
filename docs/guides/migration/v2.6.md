# v2.6 - Not yet released

More details can be found in the related [milestone](https://github.com/kalisio/kdk/milestone/14) on GitHub.

## Major breaking changes

💥 Renamed functions in `utils.locale.js` to resolve confusion between `getLocale` and `getAppLocale`, which previously led to inconsistent behavior and locale-related issues.
* Renamed `getLocale` to `getBrowserLocale`
* Renamed `getAppLocale` to `getLocale`.
* Renamed `getAppFallbackLocale` to `getFallbackLocale`

::: tip
Both `getLocale`and `getFallbackLocale` have a new signature and allows you to retrieve the full locale in the language-region format (e.g., en-GB). For instance, if the locale is `en-GB`, then
```
console.log(getLocale()) 
// => en
console.log(getLocale(false)) 
// => en-GB
```

💥 Renamed `KLayersSelector` component to `KLayersList` and added new `KLayersSelector` component

::: danger
The new `KLayersSelector` component is NOT the old `KLayersSelector` component. They are entirely different components, and `KLayersList` should be now used in place of the old `KLayersSelector` ❗
:::

💥 Test libs have been updated to work with Puppeteer v24, and Puppeteer has been removed from the KDK:
* Test libs have been moved out of test/client core & map folders and placed at the root of the test directory. Users should update any scripts copying those libraries to applications, in order to not overwrite app-specific test files, or have them detected as tests to be ran
* `page.waitForTimeout`, `$x` and `page.waitForXPath` have been deprecated in Puppeteer v24. Any apps still using them must be updated to the following replacements:
  * `page.waitForTimeout` ==> `core.waitForTimeout` (new util function in the KDK test libs)
  * `$x` ==> `$$` with 'xpath/.' as a prefix for the argument
  * `page.waitForXPath` ==> `page.waitForSelector` with 'xpath/.' as a prefix for the argument

💥 Removed `getColorFromPalette` in `utils.colors.js` in favor of `getHtmlColor` for consistency and performance.
